# Garrotxa
Metal distortion designed for heavy rhythms, offering a dense, powerful and full-bodied sound, ideal for modern metal and death metal, thanks to its advanced parametric EQ that allows you to sculpt the bass and mids for an ultra-focused tone, achieving a defined and massive sound, with the ability to enhance high-gain amplifier channels.
